# Caries-Trajectory
Trajectory analysis of tooth decay using K-means for longitudinal data.
The purpose of this project was to built a machine learning model for the prediction of the risk of tooth decay in permanent dentition.  The end product of this project is a web-based app which can be used by individuals and dentists to predict the risk of tooth decay based on their day to day consumption.
